XSchema is a more powerful alternative to DTD.
DOM (Document Object Model) is created when a browser loads a web page. (tree structure)
SAX (Simple API for XML) is a standard (diagram).
StAX (Streaming API for XML) for reading-writing XML documents. (DOM/event based)
XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) manipulates (add/remove/rearrange/sort) elements from an output file. (far more sophisticated than CSS)
RDF (Resource Description Framework) is designed to be read by computers and describes time schedules for web events, info about web pagers, electronic libraries etc.
OWL (Ontology Web Language) - something about ontologies, definitely not for the human eye.
SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a semantic language for databases, retrieves and manipulates data stored in RDF format.
